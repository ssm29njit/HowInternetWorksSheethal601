                        <p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (see the original proposal). He coined
                            the term "World Wide Web," wrote the first World Wide Web server, "httpd," and the first
                            client program (a browser and editor), "WorldWideWeb," in October 1990. He wrote the first
                            version of the "HyperText Markup Language" (HTML), the document formatting language with the
                            capability for hypertext links that became the primary publishing format for the Web. His
                            initial specifications for URIs, HTTP, and HTML were refined and discussed in larger circles
                            as Web technology spread.
                            .</p>
                        <p>In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the
                            Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Computer Science [MIT/LCS] in
                            collaboration with CERN, where the Web originated (see information on the original CERN
                            Server), with support from DARPA and the European Commission.!.</p>
                        <div class="wp-caption"><img src="images/at.jpg
" alt=""/></div>
                        <p>In 1998, the browser market was dominated by Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4.
                            A beta version of Internet Explorer 5 was then released, and it implemented a new and
                            proprietary dynamic HTML, which meant that professional web developers needed to know five
                            different ways of writing JavaScript.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a result, a group of professional web developers and designers banded together. This
                            group called themselves the Web Standards Project (WaSP). The idea was that by calling the
                            W3C documents standards rather than recommendations, they might be able to convince
                            Microsoft and Netscape to support them.P.
                            . </p>
                        <p> The early method of spreading the call to action was to use a traditional advertising
                            technique called a roadblock, where a company would take out an advert on all broadcast
                            channels at the same time, so no matter how a viewer would flick between channels, they
                            would get exactly the same message. The WaSP published an article simultaneously on various
                            web development focused sites including builder.com, Wired online, and some popular mailing
                            lists.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another technique the WaSP used was to ridicule the companies involved with the W3C (and
                            other standards bodies) that focused more on creating new, often self-serving, features
                            rather than working to get the basic existing standards supported correctly in their
                            products to start with (this includes some browser companies that shall remain nameless
                            here). This doesn't mean that the WaSP ridiculed the W3C themselves, rather they ridiculed
                            the companies that became W3C members and then misbehaved..
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The W3C has a few full time staff, but most of the people who work on the standards are
                            volunteers from member companies, eg Microsoft, Opera, Mozilla, Apple, Google, IBM and
                            Adobe, to name a few of the bigger ones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This all sounds a bit negative, but the WaSP didn’t just sit there criticising people —
                            they also helped. Seven members formed the CSS Samurai, who identified the top ten problems
                            with the CSS support in Opera and other browsers (Opera fixed their problems,
                            others did not).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After 2003, web standards didn't just sit still. New practices started to really come to
                            the forefront, with many web sites being more like desktop applications than static pages.
                            This new breed of sites is way more complicated than what the web was really intended for,
                            and we still have to concern ourselves with making them semantic, accessible and usable!

                            When HTML 4 was nearing completion, the W3C decided (in a workshop run in 1998) that in
                            terms of markup languages, the future of the Web was XML and XHTML, not HTML (comparison
                            of XHTML and HTML). So the W3C drew a line under HTML 4.01 and instead concentrated on the
                            XHTML 1.0 spec, finished in early 2000. XHTML 1.0 is just the same as HTML 4.01, except that
                            it uses the stricter markup syntax rules of XML (more on this later). XHTML 2.0 soon
                            followed, which added a whole bunch of new powerful features, and aimed to be the next
                            big thing on the Web.

                            The trouble with XHTML 2.0 is that it wasn't backwards compatible with the markup already
                            on the Web — the elements worked differently, XHTML did not work properly in Internet
                            Explorer, which still has the majority browser marketshare as of the time of writing, the
                            developer tools available weren't ready for working with XML, and it didn't reflect what
                            web developers were REALLY doing out there in the wild wild web.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HTML5 is a really good thing for web developers and designers, because it:

                            Is mostly backwards compatible with what's already there — you don't need to learn
                            completely new languages to use HTML5. The new markup features work in the same way as the
                            old ones (although the semantics of some elements have been changed — we will cover these
                            differences in a future article), and the new APIs are based on mostly the same
                            JavaScript/DOM that developers have been programming in for years.
                            Adds powerful new features to HTML that were previously only available on the Web using
                            plugin technologies like Flash, or with complex JavaScript and hacks. Form validation and
                            video are prime examples.Is better suited to writing dynamic applications than previous
                            HTML versions (HTML was originally designed for creating static documents).
                            Has a clearly defined parsing algorithm so that all browsers implementing HTML5 will create
                            the same DOM from the same markup, regardless of validity. This is a massive win for
                            interoperability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            o begin to address this, work started on CSS3 as early as 2000. The spec writers decided on
                            a modular structure, with different pieces of distinct functionality being broken down
                            into manageable chunks. This made it easier not only for the writers to write, but also for
                            the browsers to implement, and the web designers/developers to learn. A lot more features
                            have been added since the first spec version in 2000, and we didn't start to see browser
                            support for many of the features until about 2006. At the time of writing, CSS3 has over
                            40 modules in various stages of completion.
